# Xcode Target Configuration for Live Activities

## Files and Their Targets

### Main App Target (nowcath):
âœ… Add these files to the main app target:
- `nowcath/CathNowActivityAttributes.swift`
- `nowcath/LiveActivityManager.swift`
- `nowcath/ContentView.swift` (already in target)

### Widget Extension Target (CathNowLiveActivity):
âœ… Add these files to the widget extension target:
- `CathNowLiveActivity/CathNowLiveActivityBundle.swift`
- `CathNowLiveActivity/CathNowLiveActivity.swift`
- `CathNowLiveActivity/Info.plist`
- `CathNowLiveActivity/AppIntent.swift` (generated by Xcode)
- `CathNowLiveActivity/Assets.xcassets` (generated by Xcode)

### Shared Between Both Targets:
âœ… Make sure this file is added to BOTH targets:
- `nowcath/CathNowActivityAttributes.swift` (contains the shared data structure)

## Project Settings Required:

### Main App Target Settings:
1. **Info.plist or Target Settings:**
   - Add "Supports Live Activities" = YES (NSSupportsLiveActivities)
   - Minimum iOS Deployment Target: 16.1 or later

### Widget Extension Target Settings:
1. **Bundle Identifier:** Should be `your.main.app.bundleid.CathNowLiveActivity`
2. **Minimum iOS Deployment Target:** 16.1 or later
3. **Widget Extension Info.plist:** Already configured

## How to Add Files to Targets in Xcode:

1. **Select the file** in the Project Navigator
2. **Open File Inspector** (right panel)
3. **Check the appropriate targets** in the "Target Membership" section:
   - For `CathNowActivityAttributes.swift`: Check BOTH main app AND widget extension targets
   - For other files: Check the appropriate target as listed above

## Verification:
- Build both targets to ensure no compile errors
- Test Live Activity functionality on a device with iOS 16.1+
- Verify Dynamic Island appears when app is backgrounded with active alarm

## Current Status:
âœ… All Live Activity code implementation complete
âœ… File structure properly organized
âœ… Widget extension properly configured
