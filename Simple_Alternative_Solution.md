# Simple Alternative: Use Target Settings Instead of Info.plist File

## 🎯 Easier Solution: Remove Custom Info.plist and Use Xcode Settings

Instead of dealing with Info.plist file conflicts, let's use Xcode's built-in target settings:

### Step 1: Remove Custom Info.plist
1. **Right-click `nowcath/Info.plist` in Project Navigator**
2. **Choose "Delete" → "Move to Trash"**

### Step 2: Add Live Activities Support in Target Settings
1. **Select project → `nowcath` target**
2. **Go to "Info" tab**
3. **In "Custom iOS Target Properties" section:**
4. **Click the "+" button**
5. **Add this property:**
   - **Key:** `NSSupportsLiveActivities`
   - **Type:** Boolean
   - **Value:** YES

### Step 3: Clean and Build
1. **Product → Clean Build Folder**
2. **Product → Build**

## ✅ Advantages of This Approach:
- No file conflicts
- Xcode manages Info.plist automatically
- Same functionality as custom Info.plist
- Less prone to configuration errors

## 🔄 If You Want to Keep Custom Info.plist:
Follow the previous guide to remove it from "Copy Bundle Resources" while keeping it as the "Info.plist File" in Build Settings.

## 📝 Note:
Both approaches achieve the same result - enabling Live Activities support. The target settings approach is often simpler and less error-prone.
