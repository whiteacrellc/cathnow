# Cath Now

This is an application to remind people who use intermittant catheters when to
cath. It collects no personal information, in fact it doesn't talk to the internet at all. 
It is currently being tested internally in TestFlight. If you want to join the testing
create a pull request with your email and I will add you (and delete the pull request)
